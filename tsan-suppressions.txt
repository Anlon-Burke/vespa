# There is an explicit (and documented) mutex order inversion in the MergeThrottler component
# that cannot cause a deadlock in practice due to separately maintained invariants for when the
# mutexes can be locked. Of course, TSan is not able to infer this by itself, so silence this
# particular warning.
