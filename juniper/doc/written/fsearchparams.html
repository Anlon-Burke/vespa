<h1>Juniper Configuration Documentation</h1>

<b>Note:</b> This document describes in details the functionality of Juniper v.2.1.0.
The document has gradually become more and more for internal use for
instance for detailed tuning
by Professional Service. A more high level and less detailed user level
configuration documentation is also available.
<p>
Juniper implements a combined proximity ranking and dynamic teaser result
processing module.This module is intended to be interfaced to by different
Fast software modules on demand. Currently, the only available module that
makes use of Juniper is the Fast Server module, in which Juniper currently
is an integrated part of <dfn>fsearch</dfn> (the search engine executable
that runs on each search node in the system).

<h2>Juniper simple description of functionality/implementation</h2>

The document body is stripped for markup during document processing and
stored as an extended document summary field. 
A max limit of how much of the document that gets stored is configurable as
of Fast Server v.4.17 (see the Fast Serverï¿½configuration documentation for
details).  For each document
on the result page, this document extract is retrieved and fed through
Juniper which will perform the following steps:

<ol>
  <li> Scan the stripped document text (docsum) for matches of the query,
  create a data structure containing information about those matches,
  and provide a quality measure (rank boost value) that can be used as a
  metric to determine the quality of the document wrt. proximity and
  position of the search string in the document. The data structure
  contains ao. a list of matches of the query ordered by quality (see below
  for the quality measure). The document quality measure is computed from the
  quality measure of the best of the individual matches and the total
  number of hits within the document.

  <li> Generate a dynamic teaser based on the data structure previously
  generated. The dynamic teaser is composed of a number of text segments
  that include the "best" matches of the query in that
  document. The teaser is presented with the query words highlighted.
  The definition of highlight is configurable. If the document is short
  enough to fit completely into the configured teaser length, it will be
  provided as is, but with highlighting of the relevant keywords.
</ol>

Step 2 is only necessary if the teaser is going to be displayed, which
might be a decision taken on basis of the quality measure provided in step 1.

<h3>Quality measure</h3>
The text segments matching the query are ranked by (in decreasing order of
significance):

<ol>
  <li> Completeness * keyword weight - 
       higher ranking if more search words are present in
       the same context, and relatively higher weight on matches that
       contains "important" terms compared to matches with stop words if
       equal number of words.
  <li> Proximity - query terms occurring near each other is better
  <li> Position - earlier in document is better
</ol>

The number of matches selected is based on text segment lengths including
a configurable amound of surrounding text, the number of matching segments
to use (configurable) and the required total summary
size (configurable). The final set of matches is 
returned with markup for the hits and the abbreviated sections
(continuation symbol).

The query used for teaser generation has undergone proper name recognition
and English spell checking. Highlighting is done on individual terms of the
query. In particular, phrases are broken down into individual terms, but
the preference to proximal terms will maintain the phrasing in the
generated teaser.  

Lemmatization by expanding documents with word inflections cannot be used
by Juniper. In the future, Juniper would expand the query based on the
original query and language information. This functionality is not
available yet, thus lemmatized terms will in general not be highlighted by
Juniper.

Currently Juniper uses an alternative, simple brute force stemming
algorithm that basically allows prefixes of the document words to match if
the document word in question is no longer than P (configurable) bytes
<i>longer</i> than the query keyword. 
This algorithm works well for keywords of a certain size, but not for very
short keywords. Thus an additional configuration variable defines a lower
bound for what lengths of keywords that will be subject to this algorithm.
With this simple algorithm in place, typical weak form singular to plural
mapping will get highlighted while the opposite, going from a long form to
a shorter one will not work as might be expected. Eg. this algorithm does
not change the keywords themselves. Consequently, the shorter forms of the
keywords are more likely to give non-exact hits in the dynamic summary.


<h2>Fast Search configuration of Juniper</h2>
Enabling Juniper functionality within Fast Search is done on a per field
basis by means of override specifications in summary.map. 
Currently the following override specs are supported by Juniper:
<p>
<ul>
<li><pre>override &lt;outputfield&gt; dynamicteaser &lt;inputfield&gt;</pre>
<li><pre>override &lt;outputfield&gt; dynamicteasermetric
&lt;inputfield&gt;</pre>
<li><pre>override &lt;outputfield&gt; juniperlog &lt;inputfield&gt;</pre>
</ul>
<p>
Details of the override directive can be found in <i>Fast Search 4.13 -
Dynamic Docsum Generation Framework</i>.
The <tt>dynamicteasermetric</tt> field provides a ranking of the document
based on a corresponding metric as that used to select between individual
matches for dynamic teaser generation inside a document. See the section on
using Juniper for proximity boosting <a href="#proximity">below</a>
The <tt>juniperlog</tt> field is new as of Juniper 2.0, and is used to
retrieve the information generated by Juniper by means of the log query
option, see the runtime option table <a href="#dynpar">below</a>.

Note that when integrated into Data Search 3.1 and later, 
this part of the configuration will be generated via
<ol>
<li>The index profile
<li>The index configuration (indexConfig.xml) by the config server.
</ol>

<h3>Configuration levels</h3>
When integrated into Fast Search, Juniper receives its default parameters from
global settings in the <dfn>fsearchrc</dfn> config file. 
These configuration parameter settings must be preconfigured at
<dfn>fsearch</dfn> process startup time. Two levels of system configuration
is currently supported, 
<ol>
<li><b>System default configuration:</b> This is the configuration settings
exemplified by the parameter descriptions below.
<li><b>Per field configuration:</b>By using the field names instead of the
string "juniper" as prefix, the default setting can be overridden on a
<dfn>result field</dfn> basis. Eg. setting for instance
<pre>myfield.dynsum.length 512</pre> (see below) would allow the
<tt>myfield</tt> result field to receive a different teaser length.
</ol>
In addition Juniper 2.x supports changing certain subset of the parameters
on a per query basis. See <a href="#dynpar">separate section</a> on this below.
<p>
<b>Performance note:</b> The per field configuration possibility should be used with
care since overriding some parameters may cause significant computation
overhead in that Juniper would have to scan the whole text multiple times.
Changing the <tt>dynsum</tt> group of fields is generally quite performance
conservative (only the teaser generation phase would have to be repeated), 
while changing any of the <tt>stem</tt> or <tt>matcher</tt>
fields would require a different text scan for each combination of
parameters.

<h3>Arbitrary byte sequences in markup parameters</h3>
To allow arbitrary byte seqences (such as low ascii values) to be used to
denote highlight on/off and continuation symbol(s), Juniper now accepts
strings on the form \xNN where the N's are hex values [0-9a-fA-F].
This will be converted into a byte value of NN. Note that Juniper exports
UTF-8 text so this sequence should be a valid UTF-8 byte sequence. No
checks are performed from Juniper on the validity of such strings in the
<dfn>fsearch</dfn> domain.
As a consequence of this, occurrences of backslash must be escaped
accordingly (<dfn>\\</dfn>).


<h3>Blanks in text parameters must be escaped</h3>
Note that <dfn>fsearchrc</dfn> does not accept blanks in the
parameters. To allow more complicated highlight markup, the sequence
<dfn>\x20</dfn> must be used as space in text fields. 

<p>
<h3><a name="em"></a>Escaping markup in the summary text</h3>
Since Juniper may supply markup through the use of the
highlight and continuation parameters, problems may occur if the
analysed text itself contains markup. To avoid this, Juniper may be
configured to escape the 5 XML/HTML markup symbols
(<dfn>&quot;&amp;&lt;&apos;&gt;</dfn>) before adding the mentioned
parametrized symbols. See the description of the
juniper.dynsum.escape_markup parameter <a href="#empar">below</a>.

The following variables are available for static, global configuration for
a particular search node:

<h2><a name="dynpar"></a>Alternate behaviour of Juniper on a per query
basis</h2>
As of Juniper v.2.x and Fastserver v.4.17, and QRserver for Data Search
3.2, Juniper supports a number of Juniper specific options that can be
provided as part of the URL. The format of the option string is 
<pre>
  juniper=&lt;param_name&gt;.&lt;value&gt;[_&lt;param_name&gt;.&lt;value&gt;]*
</pre>
As an example, consider the following URL addition:
<pre>
  juniper=near.2_dynlength.512_dynmatches.8
</pre>
If this string is present in the URL, Juniper would generate teasers that
are up to twice as long and contains up to twice as many matches of the
query compared to the default values. 
In addition, teasers (and <a href="#proximity">proximity metric</a>) will
only be
generated for those documents that fulfills the extra constraint that there
exist at least one complete match of the query where the distance in words
between the first and the last word of the query match is no more than 2 (+
the number of words in the query).

<h3>Supported per query options in Juniper 2.1.0</h3>

</td>
</table>

<h3>Juniper debug template in Data Search</h3>
Template support for the log parameter as well as extracting the whole
juniper input document text is provided by Data Search 3.2 by means of the
<tt>jsearch</tt> page from the qrserver port. Replace <tt>asearch</tt>
with <tt>jsearch</tt> 
in the URL of a qrserver privileged port search. 

<h2>Using Juniper for proximity boosting with the QRserver</h2>
In order to use Juniper to boost hits that have good proximity of the query
(or to filter the hits based on NEAR or WITHIN constraints) the QRserver
would need to be provided with the following URL addition:
<pre>
rpf_proximitybooster:enabled=1
</pre>
Note that Juniper will return 0 as proximity metric (dynamicteasermetric)
if the query with juniper option constraints cannot be satisfied by
the information in the configured input field. Thus if the selection of a
hit is done solely on the basis of information not present in the Juniper input
(such as the title in the default configuration)
proximity boosting may demote such hits. A solution for this problem has
been proposed for future versions of Juniper.

<h3><a name="qrserver"></a>Supported QRserver options to use with proximity
boosting via Juniper</h3>
QRserver behaviour wrt. proximity boosting can be set both in configuration
(at QRserver startup) or on a per query basis. In the below table, some of the
default configuration settings are listed together with their corresponding
runtime setting, if any. Consult QRserver documentation for the complete
list of options.

<h2>Configuring Juniper within Data Search</h2>
Except where explicitly noted, configuring Juniper for Data Search is
similar to configuring for Real-Time Search. As of Data Search 3.0 Juniper
is by default configured and enabled in Data Search.

<h2>Configuring Juniper within Fast Real-Time Search</h2>
Juniper is provided as part of Real-Time Search (through Fast Search) 
starting with version 2.4. To enable the Fast Search integrated Juniper in
a Real-Time Search environment, see the documentation extensions to
Real-Time Search 2.4. Note that to configure Juniper within Real-Time
Search, the configuration variables should be put in the
<tt>etc/fsearch.addon*</tt> file(s) which will be used as input when Real-Time
Search generates <tt>fsearchrc</tt> files for all configured search
engines. Also a proper <tt>summary.map</tt> file is needed to enable the
dynamic summaries on particular fields.

<h2>Configuring Juniper for Fast Search v.4.15 and higher</h2>
Newer versions of Fast Search provide template support to allow different
Juniper markup depending on the type of display desired (plain,html or
xml). 

All the http frontends that needs an interpretation of the highlight
information provided by Juniper should have the following setup for Juniper:
<p>
<table>
<tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0"><td>juniper.dynsum.highlight_on</td><td>\02</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0"><td>juniper.dynsum.highlight_off</td><td>\03</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0"><td>juniper.dynsum.continuation</td><td>\1E</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The actual frontend markup configuration then takes place by setting
variables such as
<p>
<table>
<tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0"><td>tvm.dynsum.html.highlight_on</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0"><td>tvm.dynsum.xml.highlight_off</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
in the relevant rc file. 

<h2>How to report bugs/errors related to Juniper</h2>
Errors/problems related to Juniper can be divided into two categories:
<ol>
  <li> Problems with specific documents/teasers
  <li> System errors/instability etc.
</ol>
Due to the complexity of a full, running system it is much easier for all
parts if the particular query/document pair triggering the problem can be
identified and analysed off-line.

<h3>Problems with specific teasers</h3>
Problems of this category is likely to occur because there are so many
combinations of queries and documents that it is not possible to
test for all cases. To be able to analyse such problems, it is vital that
the exact (byte-by-byte) teaser generation source (document summary input
to Juniper) can be made available together with the exact query as
presented to Juniper. To determine this requires the following information:
<ol>
   <li> The teaser source docsum. The name of the docsum field is dependent
   on the configuration in summary.map. The data should be provided without
   any post processing performed, if possible, to avoid missing problems
   related to bad input data such as malformet UTF8 characters.
   <li> The original query as submitted by the user
   <li> The expanded query (available under <tt>var/log/querylogs/</tt>)
   <li> A corresponding <tt>fsearchrc</tt> (pure fastserver4)  or
   <tt>fsearch.addon</tt> (Real Time Search/DS 3.x) file used by the
   fsearch process that performed the task.
</ol>


<h3>System errors/instability problems</h3>
Problems of category 2 should, if occurring at all only be associated with
development/beta releases. If such an unfortunate event should happen, the
following information <dfn>in addition to the information associated with
category 1</dfn> would be useful to pin down the problem:
<ol>
  <li> Core file of <dfn>fsearch</dfn> accompanied with the associated
  <dfn>fsearch</dfn> binary.
  <li> Log files from the crashed process (in Data Search these will be
  present as <tt>var/fsearch-*.log</tt> and <tt>var/log/stdout.log</tt>.
</ol>
